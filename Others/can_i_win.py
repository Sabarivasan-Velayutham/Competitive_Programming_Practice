# Two players take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement 
# until they reach a total â‰¥ 100.

# Given an integer maxChoosableInt and another integer desiredTotal, determine if the 
# first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.

# You can always assume that maxChoosableInt will not be larger than 20 and 
# desiredTotal will not be larger than 300. Below is an example explanation.

# Input:
# maxChoosableInteger = 10
# desiredTotal = 11

# Output:
# false

# Explanation:
# No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
# The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
# If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
# The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
# Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
